creational, structural, behavioral, and architectural design patterns. 

### Creational design patterns

provide a mechanism for creating objects in a specific situationg without revealing the creation method.

- Factory, Constructor, Abstract, Prototype, Singleton, Builder

### Structural design patterns

Let you add new functionalities to objects so that restructuring some parts of the system does not effect the rest. When some parts of structure change, the entire system doesn not need to change.

- Decorator, Facade, Adapter, Composite, Bridge, Flyweight, Proxy

### Behavioral design patterns

concerned with communication between dissimilar objects in a system. The streamline the communication and make sure the information is synchronized between such objects.

- State, Template Method, Revealing Module Chain of Responsibility, Strategy, Interpreter, Command, Observer Iterator, Mediator, Visitor, Memento

### Architectural design patterns

Solving architectural problems within a given context in software architecture.

- MVC, MVP, MVVM

## Creational Patterns

- provide optimized object creation techniques
- also help control the creation of objects

### Factory Pattern

- *Provides a template* that can be used to create objects
- It provides a generic interface that delegates the object creation responsibility to the corresponding subclass.

```javascript
class IceCreamFactory {
  constructor() {
    this.createIcecream = function(flavor) {
      let iceCream;
      if (flavor === "chocolate") {
        iceCream = new Chocolate();
      }
      else if (flavor === "mint") {
        iceCream = new Mint();
      }
      else if (flavor === "strawberry") {
        iceCream = new Strawberry();
      }
      return iceCream;
    }
  }
}

class Chocolate {
  constructor() {
    this.icecreamFlavor = "chocolate";
    this.message = function() {
      return `You chose the ${this.icecreamFlavor} flavor.`;
    };
  }
}

class Mint {
  constructor() {
    this.icecreamFlavor = "mint";
    this.message = function() {
      return `You chose the ${this.icecreamFlavor} flavor.`;
    };
  }
}

class Strawberry{
  constructor() {
    this.icecreamFlavor = "strawberry";
    this.message = function() {
      return `You chose the ${this.icecreamFlavor} flavor.`;
    };
  }
}

// creating objects
const iceCreamfactory = new IceCreamFactory();

const chocolate = iceCreamfactory.createIcecream('chocolate');
const mint = iceCreamfactory.createIcecream('mint');
const strawberry = iceCreamfactory.createIcecream('strawberry');
```
